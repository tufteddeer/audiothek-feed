== Building

The project consists of two Parts: The Rust backend and the HTML/HTMX frontend.

=== Using Nix

Both parts are built using a https://nixos.org/[Nix] Flake that provides a package for each one, where the backend package depends on the frontend.
The result of the frontend build is embedded in the Rust binary at compile time, which locates the artifacts using the `FRONTEND_DIR` environment variable.

[source, bash]
----
nix run

=== Using Cargo 

The `devShell` sets `FRONTEND_DIR` to the `frontend` source directory so `cargo run` works as well. If you are not using a Nix shell, you must set `FRONTEND_DIR` manually.

[source, bash]
----
nix shell
cargo run
